## Prerequisites

- Node.js 14.0.0 or higher
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Quick Start

For a quick overview of how to use the tool:

```bash
npm run help
```

Or run a website audit immediately:

```bash
node audit.js yourwordpresssite.com
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To audit any WordPress website, provide the website URL:

```bash
node audit.js yourwordpresssite.com
```

The tool accepts URLs in multiple formats:

```bash
# Without protocol (https:// will be added automatically)
node audit.js yourwordpresssite.com

# With protocol
node audit.js https://yourwordpresssite.com

# Direct sitemap URL (if non-standard location)
node audit.js https://yourwordpresssite.com/custom-sitemap.xml
```

The tool will automatically append `/sitemap_index.xml` to the base URL to find the WordPress sitemap.

### Using npm scripts

NPM scripts are available but require you to pass the website URL:

```bash
# Run audit with website URL
npm run audit -- yourwordpresssite.com

# Run audit and automatically open report in browser
npm run audit:open -- yourwordpresssite.com

# Run audit in maximum reliability mode
npm run audit:reliable -- yourwordpresssite.com

# Run audit in reliability mode and open report
npm run audit:reliable:open -- yourwordpresssite.com

# Run example programmatic usage
npm run example -- yourwordpresssite.com
```

**Note:** The double dash (`--`) is required when passing arguments to npm scripts.

### Additional Scripts

- **audit-and-open.js**: Runs the audit and automatically opens the report in your default browser
- **run-reliable-audit.js**: Runs the audit with pre-configured settings for maximum reliability
- **example-usage.js**: Shows how to use the audit script programmatically in CI/CD pipelines

All scripts require a website URL as an argument:

```bash
node audit-and-open.js yourwordpresssite.com
node run-reliable-audit.js yourwordpresssite.com
node example-usage.js yourwordpresssite.com
```

## Output

The script generates a `report.html` file in the current directory containing:

- **Summary Statistics**: Total pages scanned, successful/failed checks, total issues
- **Issue Breakdown**: Count of errors and warnings
- **Page-by-Page Results**: Each page with its accessibility issues
- **Issue Details**: 
  - Issue type (error/warning)
  - WCAG code reference
  - Descriptive message
  - HTML context snippet
  - CSS selector

## Report Structure

The HTML report includes:

1. **Header Section**
   - Site URL
   - Generation timestamp
   - WCAG standard used

2. **Summary Cards**
   - Pages scanned
   - Successful checks
   - Failed checks
   - Total issues
   - Errors count
   - Warnings count

3. **Detailed Results**
   - Each page with its title and URL
   - List of all accessibility issues
   - Context and selectors for debugging

## Configuration

### Default Settings
The script uses these conservative pa11y settings for maximum reliability:
- Standard: WCAG 2.1 Level AA
- Timeout: 90 seconds per page (configurable)
- Wait: 3 seconds after page load (configurable)
- Includes warnings (but not notices)
- Max retries: 3 attempts per URL
- Concurrent checks: 1 (single check at a time)
- Delay between requests: 5 seconds
- Batch size: 3 URLs per batch

These defaults prioritize reliability over speed. For faster scans on stable sites, you can increase concurrency.

### Environment Variables
You can customize the behavior using environment variables:

```bash
# Concurrency and Performance
PA11Y_MAX_CONCURRENT=3          # Max simultaneous checks (default: 2)
PA11Y_BATCH_SIZE=10             # URLs per batch (default: 5)
PA11Y_REQUEST_DELAY=3000        # Delay between requests in ms (default: 2000)

# Timeouts
PA11Y_PAGE_TIMEOUT=90000        # Page load timeout in ms (default: 60000)
PA11Y_PAGE_WAIT=3000           # Wait after page load in ms (default: 2000)
PA11Y_NAV_TIMEOUT=90000        # Navigation timeout in ms (default: 60000)

# Retry Configuration
PA11Y_MAX_RETRIES=5            # Max retry attempts (default: 3)
PA11Y_RETRY_DELAY=10000        # Initial retry delay in ms (default: 5000)
PA11Y_RETRY_MULTIPLIER=1.5     # Retry delay multiplier (default: 2)
```

### Example with Custom Configuration

```bash
# Run with increased concurrency and timeouts
PA11Y_MAX_CONCURRENT=5 PA11Y_PAGE_TIMEOUT=120000 node audit.js yourwordpresssite.com

# Run with maximum reliability settings
PA11Y_MAX_CONCURRENT=1 PA11Y_MAX_RETRIES=5 PA11Y_REQUEST_DELAY=5000 node audit.js yourwordpresssite.com
```

## Why Custom Report Generation?

This tool uses custom HTML report generation instead of standard pa11y reporters because:

1. **Multi-page aggregation**: Standard pa11y reporters (pa11y-reporter-html, pa11y-reporter-html-plus) are designed for single-page reports. We need to aggregate results from multiple URLs.

2. **Summary statistics**: We calculate and display totals across all pages (total issues, errors, warnings, etc.)

3. **Unified report**: All results are combined into a single `report.html` file with navigation and filtering

4. **Custom formatting**: The report includes WordPress-specific context and better organization for multi-page audits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Timeout errors**: 
   - The enhanced version automatically retries timed-out pages
   - Default timeout increased to 90 seconds
   - Increase timeout further: `PA11Y_PAGE_TIMEOUT=120000 node audit.js yoursite.com`
   - Script runs with single concurrent check by default for reliability

2. **"Failed action" errors**: 
   - The script no longer uses Pa11y actions that can cause failures
   - Uses built-in wait option instead of action-based waits
   - All problematic wait commands have been removed

3. **Network errors**: 
   - The script includes retry logic for all network failures
   - Increase retry attempts: `PA11Y_MAX_RETRIES=5 node audit.js yoursite.com`
   - Default delay between requests increased to 5 seconds

4. **Memory issues**: 
   - For very large sites, increase Node.js memory:
   ```bash
   node --max-old-space-size=4096 audit.js yoursite.com
   ```
   - Default batch size reduced to 3 for better stability

5. **Rate limiting**: 
   - Default configuration uses 5-second delays between requests
   - Single concurrent check prevents overwhelming servers
   - For even more conservative settings:
   ```bash
   PA11Y_REQUEST_DELAY=10000 node audit.js yoursite.com
   ```

6. **Sitemap not found**: 
   - The tool looks for `/sitemap_index.xml` by default
   - If your WordPress site uses a different sitemap location, provide the full URL:
   ```bash
   node audit.js https://yoursite.com/sitemap.xml
   node audit.js https://yoursite.com/wp-sitemap.xml
   ```

### Error Handling

The enhanced script provides robust error handling:
- **Automatic Retries**: Failed checks are retried with exponential backoff
- **Error Classification**: Distinguishes between retryable and non-retryable errors
- **Graceful Degradation**: Failed pages don't stop the audit
- **Detailed Logging**: Shows retry attempts and specific error messages
- **Browser Cleanup**: Ensures all browser instances are closed on exit
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates with retry information

### Performance Tips

1. **For faster scans**: Increase concurrency
   ```bash
   PA11Y_MAX_CONCURRENT=5 PA11Y_BATCH_SIZE=10 node audit.js yoursite.com
   ```

2. **For more reliable scans**: Reduce concurrency and increase delays
   ```bash
   PA11Y_MAX_CONCURRENT=1 PA11Y_REQUEST_DELAY=5000 node audit.js yoursite.com
   ```

3. **For problematic sites**: Maximum reliability settings
   ```bash
   PA11Y_MAX_CONCURRENT=1 PA11Y_MAX_RETRIES=5 PA11Y_PAGE_TIMEOUT=120000 PA11Y_REQUEST_DELAY=5000 node audit.js yoursite.com
   ```
